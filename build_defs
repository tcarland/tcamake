# tcamake/build_defs
#   To be included by the Top-Level Makefile or TOPDIR.
# Use 'project_defs' for a project level Makefile.

export TCAMAKE_PROJECT="true"

# Additional variables used by the build system or for projects
# can be set here. Some examples:
#
# generally we wouldn't set this globally here but source from 
# within our project at build time
#export TCAMAKE_DEBUG = 1

# The install prefix that can be used within the 'make install' target. 
#TCAMAKE_PREFIX="${HOME}/tnms"

# Includes can be controlled across projects by defining a few 
# USE_xx flags.
# Define these in your top-level Makefile or project Makefile 
# eg.
# USE_MYSQL=1  
# USE_PTHREADS=1
# USE_LIBRT=1
